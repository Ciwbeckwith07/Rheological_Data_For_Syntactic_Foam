# Rheological_Data_For_Syntactic_Foam
This dataset contains raw viscosity measurements exported directly from an Anton Paar rheometer using RheoCompass software.
The files correspond to experiments conducted on composite resin formulations at varying hollow glass microsphere (HGM) loadings, shear rates, and temperatures.

Each file represents a single test run and includes both numeric measurement data and instrument-generated metadata blocks.
